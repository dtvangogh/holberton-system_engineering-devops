## Project tasks :wrench:
### [0. Install MySQL ](./0x14-mysql) 
* First things first, let’s get MySQL installed on both your web-01 and web-02 servers.
### [1. Let us in! ](./README.md) 
* In order for us to verify that your servers are properly configured, we need you to create a user and password for both MySQL databases which will allow the checker access to them.
### [2. If only you could see what I've seen with your eyes ](./web-01) 
* In order for you to set up replication, you’ll need to have a database with at least one table and one row in your primary MySQL server (web-01) to replicate from.
### [3. Quite an experience to live in fear, isn't it? ](./holberton_user) 
* Before you get started with your primary-replica synchronization, you need one more thing in place. On your primary MySQL server (web-01), create a new user for the replica server.
### [4. Setup a Primary-Replica infrastructure using MySQL ](./tyrell_corp) 
* 
### [5. MySQL backup ](./web-02)
